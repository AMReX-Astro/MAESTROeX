This documentation is a work in progress. MAESTROeX is rapidly
evolving, so portions of the text are likely to be incomplete or
out-of-date.

MAESTROeX is an updated C++ implementation of the previous
(pure-Fortran) MAESTRO code. Thus, MAESTROeX is able to leverage the
updated capability of the AMReX software framework for massively
parallel, block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
applications. The AMReX library (and formerly, the BoxLib library) is
developed at the Center for Computational Sciences and Engineering at
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. AMReX is distributed separately
from MAESTROeX (see https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex).

The current version of the MAESTROeX User’s Guide can be found online
at https://amrex-astro.github.io/MAESTROeX/docs/index.html .

MAESTROeX is developed at the Center for Computational Sciences and
Engineering at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and at Stony
Brook University. Development is/was supported by the SciDAC Program
of the DOE Office of Mathematics, Information, and Computational
Sciences and the SciDAC Program of the DOE Office of High Energy
Physics under the U.S. Department of Energy under contract
No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 to LBNL and by a DOE/Office of Nuclear Physics
grant Nos. DE-FG02-06ER41448 and DE-FG02-87ER40317 to Stony Brook, and
the SciDAC program DOE grant DE-SC0017955.
