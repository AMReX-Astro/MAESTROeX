With the current makefile, the code should build correctly as long as
MPI=t.

Currently, the best place to run a job is from the /gpfs1/user_name/
directory.  The compute nodes do not have access to the /scratch
directory and therefore executables can not be run from there.

Each node on Intrepid contains 4 cores and 2 GB of memory.  There are
3 modes within which to run the code on a BG/P system: 1) SMP mode, 2)
DUAL node mode, and 3) VN (Virutal Node) mode.  In SMP mode, each node
is treated as a single task which has access to the full 2 GB of
memory and which can spawn 4 threads.  DUAL node mode treats each node
as having 2 tasks, each with 1 GB of memory and 2 threads.  VN mode
treats each node as having 4 tasks, each with 512 MB of memory and a
single thread.

NOTE that our code does not currently have directives for spawning
threads and as such VN mode would be best suited to our problems as
long as they can fit within the 512 MB memory restriction.

Nodes are grouped together into partitions on a BG system.  On
Intrepid, the smallest partition has 64 nodes (256 cores, total).  All
larger partitions are multiples of 2 of this smaller partition,
i.e. 128, 256, 512, etc nodes.  Partitions can not be combined and the
smallest parition which contains the number of requested nodes will be
used.  For example, if the user wants to run a 384 node job, a 512
node partition will be selected and the user will still be charged for
the 128 nodes that are sitting idle during the job.

Intrepid has 2 main queues for running jobs, a debug queue called
"prod-devel" and a production queue called "prod".  The debug queue
has a maximum runtime of 1 hour.  The production queue has a minimum
partition size of 512 nodes.  There are other queue types available,
but I think they are for runs that have requested a particular block
of time directly from ANL.

Submitting a job is done via the following command:

 qsub -t <time> -n <num_nodes> -q <queue_name> [more options] \
      <name_of_executable> [executable's args.]

where <time> is the requested number of MINUTES of wallclock time or
in a colon separated format HH:MM:SS, <num_nodes> is the number of
nodes, and <queue_name> is the name of the queue to run the job in.
There are many [more options] but an important one is the "--mode
<mode_type>" option; <mode_type> can be either "dual" or "vn".
Omitting this option defaults to SMP mode.

Monitoring jobs can be done via the "qstat" command.  Monitoring
account allocation/usage can be done using the "cbank" command.
