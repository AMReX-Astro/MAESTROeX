Development on Maestro is done on the "development" branch in the git
repo.  Nightly regression testing runs on this branch.

On the first workday of each month, we merge Maestro "development" ->
"master", and tag it as "YY.MM", using the year and month.  This same
tag is applied across all of the BoxLib astro codes and BoxLib itself,
allowing one to put each code on the same tag to get a version of the
ecosystem that was tested together.

Note: a few days before the merge day, we stop pushing to
"development", except for bug fixes, to allow us the time to get the
test suite passing.

The procedure (from Weiqun) for doing the merge is:

-- Do 'git pull' in both master and development branches.  (Use `git
   checkout xxx` to change to branch xxx.

-- In master branch, do `git merge development`.  Fix any conflicts if
   there are any.  (There should not be any conflicts unless a commit
   is checked into master directly without going through development.)

-- In master branch, commit new release notes summarizing changes
   since last major release.

-- git tag -m "BoxLib YY.MM" YY.MM

-- git push

-- git push --tags

-- git checkout development

-- git merge master

-- git push
