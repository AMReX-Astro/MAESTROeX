There are several other papers that may be appropriate to cite,
depending on which capabilities you are using.  These are discussed
below.

The development of the low Mach number formulation is described in the
following papers -- we ask that they be cited if you are discussing
the low Mach asymptotics or expansion of the background state (paper
II in particular):
