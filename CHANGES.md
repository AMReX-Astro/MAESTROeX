  * The master branch has been renamed the main branch. If you have an
    existing clone of MAESTROeX, then do the following to update for this
    change. First, do `git checkout master` if you're not already on the
    old master branch. Then do `git pull`. This will gather the updates
    to the repo, but will fail with the message `Your configuration specifies
    to merge with the ref 'refs/heads/master' from the remote, but no such ref
    was fetched.` Then you can simply do `git checkout main` and your local
    repo should automatically switch to that branch and track updates from
    the upstream repo on GitHub. If you like, you can then delete the old
    master branch with `git branch -D master`.
