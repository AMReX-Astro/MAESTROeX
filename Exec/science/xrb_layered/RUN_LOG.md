### RUN1
The first run.  Starting model is profile46 from mesa run `make_ignition_model_for_hydro`, with fe56 column depth of 4e10 (? check)
input file : inputs_2d_12cm

### RUN2
Changed the initial model with a smaller fe56 layer (column 5e9)
input file inputs_2d_high_square_12cm

### RUN3
Change to a square domain to suppress shear flows
input file inputs_2d_high_square_12cm

### RUN4
Same as run3, with twice the resolution
input file inputs_2d_high_square_6cm

### RUN5
Same as run4, with twice the resolution
input file inputs_2d_high_square_3cm
