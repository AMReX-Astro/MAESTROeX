# For a simple laminar flame setup we define the fuel and ash state.  The
# fuel parameters will be used to define the inflow boundary condition.
# the fuel and ash will be in pressure equilibrium, so the ash density
# will be found via the EOS.  The ash composition will be set by simply
# turning all the fuel into ash.
